 * Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

Input: 16

Example 2:

Input: 5

    a) There is only one bit set in the binary representation of n (or n is a power of 2)
    b) The bits donâ€™t AND(&) any part of the pattern 0xAAAAAAAA

    For example: 16 (10000) is power of 4 because there is only one bit set and 0x10 & 0xAAAAAAAA is zero.
    Why 0xAAAAAAAA ? This is because the bit representation is of powers of 2 that are not of 4. Like 2, 8, 32 so on.
